					RFID-based Healthcare Workflow Management<br/> 
							  			
					<span style="font-size:small; text-decoration:underline;">Description of Work: </span><br/>
					Xiaoyu Ma is VA-CASE Industrial Engineer and a post-doc research associate.
					Her main interests include operational decision support for real-time healthcare business process and workflow management and RFID-based visualization management system. 
					Her Ph.D. research focuses on the design and implementation of RFID-based business process and workflow management in healthcare. 
					First, this research proposes a road map to implement RFID in hospitals with performance matrixes for technology evaluation, key criteria for resolution level setting, 
					and business rules for information extraction. Second, in order to reduce healthcare associated infections caused by unclean RMEs, 
					RFID-based business process management (BPM) concepts and workflow technologies are used to transform the reprocessing procedures in a Sterile Processing Department (SPD). 
					In the proposed pattern for healthcare business process management, 
					the importance of execution status control is firstly emphasized as a key to handle complex and dynamic healthcare processes. 
					A five-level framework for service-oriented business process management is designed for SPDs to share information, integrate distributed systems, 
					and manage heterogeneous resources among multiple stakeholders. 
					This research proposes a healthcare workflow system as a deliverable solution to manage the execution phase of reprocessing procedures, 
					which supports the design, execution, monitoring, and automation of services supplied in SPDs. 
					RFID techniques are adopted to collect relative real-time data for SPD performance management. 
					Finally, by identifying key architectural requirements, the subsystems of a service-oriented architecture for the SPD workflow prototyping system, SPDFLOW, 
					are discussed in detail. 
					This research is the first effort in exploring healthcare workflow technologies in the SPD domain to improve the quality of RMEs and ensure patient safety.
					Dr. Ma is a member of IIE, INFORMS and IEEE, and a guest member of the Scientific Workflow Research Laboratory (SWR Lab), 
					one of the top five leading scientific workflow research groups in North America. 
					She has published several refereed papers for designing RFID-based business process and workflow management. 
					Her paper ¡®RTLS-based ubiquitous healthcare system design and implementation¡¯ was published as WHITE PAPER in ¡®RFID Journal¡¯, 
					the world's leading source of RFID news and insights(August 2010,). 
					She was invited as a speaker for two presentations about a roadmap to adopt RTLS in hospitals and ubiquitous control for emergent room flows in VERC Symposium, 2011. 
					She proposed Service-Oriented Architecture for SPDFLOW: A Healthcare Workflow System for Sterile Processing Departments, 
					which was published as a paper and presented in IEEE Service Computing Conference (IEEE SCC 2012) with 17% acceptance rate. 
					Another papers ¡®RFID-based healthcare workflow management system in sterile processing department¡¯ was presented in Industrial and Systems Engineering Research Conference (ISERC 2012), 
					the premier event for the world¡¯s leading industrial and system engineers.

			The main focus of Issac¡¯s research lies on exploring different engineering-driven statistical modeling approaches to address patient erroneous discharge process compliance and subsequent readmissions which results in huge wastes in Medicare costs.
			In today¡¯s US healthcare systems, hospital readmission process could be complex due to lots of reasons,<br/>
			1) not all readmissions are preventable; <br/>
			2) a readmission may be caused by various factors such as insufficient relay of post-care information from provider discharge planning system to patients and caregivers, medical errors, deterioration of a patient¡¯s clinical condition and etc.; <br/>
			3) readmissions are important not only as a quality-of-care indicator but also they consumes an unreasonable share of expenses for inpatient cares. <br/>
			Thus, using general social and demographic information as well as individual past history of readmission records from Veterans Health Administration facilities, 
			Issac aims to develop risk prediction models to effectively determine significant patient characteristics associated with higher risk of 30-day rehospitalizations that mainly caused by patient non-compliance to the medication instructions.
			He is also working on state-of-the-art adaptive classifiers that can be used to enable a real time patient classification strategy to minimize the negative impacts of unnecessary preventable readmissions.<br/>       
			Another focus of Issac¡¯s activities is to assist developing healthcare workload portfolio estimation methods for Patient Centered Medical Homes (PCMHs) that aims to provide comprehensive, coordinated, and accessible care to patients at both primary care and specialty level.
